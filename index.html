Going through series of theoretical and practical classes, this experience has equipped me with a thorough knowledge in civil engineering practice. I took on courses such as structural design, structural analysis, engineering drawing, engineering mathematics, engineering communication and economics, computer application in engineering, civil engineering practices, and so on. At the University, I joined a number of professional associations. I was a member of the Nigerian University Engineering Students Association (NUESA) and a student member of the Nigerian Society of Engineers (NSE). I also joined the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE).It was during my undergraduate studies that I begin to learn Programming. Specifically, the first Programming languages I ever wrote was QBasics and Visual Basic, both which were part of my course requirement. Later, I developed interest in programming and stated learning on my own. My self training started with the Java Programming language. Later I learned Kotlin and JavaScript. As a requirement for my bachelor's degree, I took two industrial attachments, one for 3 months and the other for 6 months.</p>
